> May odds be ever in your favor

Hi there! I'm Ray (王星磊), a postgraduate student at [LIESMARS](https://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/). Before that, I received my B.Eng degree in [Geomatics Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics) from Wuhan University. I am a novice in programming and machine learning. My current research area includes machine learning and its application in Intelligent Transportation. I am also very interested in Natural Language Processing and techniques associated with it.

Now I am an intern at [Amap](https://amap.com). Hope I can get lots of hands-on experience there!
